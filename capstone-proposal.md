### Domain Background
Market segmentation is the process of dividing customers in a given market into groups based on common attributes. This is significant in marketing because it allows for personalization and more accurate targeting in advertising campaigns. Personalization is staritng to become necessary in marketing with 74% of customers expressing frustration when website content is not personalized.(https://www.business2community.com/marketing/10-surprising-stats-personalization-01791432#M7UP7gMEHj4QOfXm.97). Moreover, 59% of customers say that personalization influences their purchasing decision.(https://www.evergage.com/blog/consumers-want-personalization-stats-roundup/). Instead of a generic, one size fits all offer, the statistics show that marketing should harness the power of personalization to provide targeted advertising to customers. 

The idea of segmentation in marketing is not a new concept. In the 1600s, retailers would segment their customers by wealth. For example, shop owners would hold private showcases of goods in their home for wealthier customers. Also, in the late 1800s, Germany toy manufactuers were using geographic segmentation to produce toy models for specific countries, like American locomotives intended to be sold in the United States.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation). Segmentation today is also done based on demographics and geography but has adapted to also include behavior and the customer's journey with respect to the buying process. 

### Problem Statement
Creating accurate and useful customer segments can be a daunting task. To create customer segments, a lot of reserach is required and a company may find that they need to conduct a study. This process can be time consuming and expensive. Often times, marketers are able to create simple segments, for example segmenting by country, age, gender, etc. But these segmentations are simple and do not contribute to understanding different segments of customers. 

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

However, by utilizing statistics and machine learning models like K-means clustering, more accurate, complex clusters can be found that also save time and money. Moreover, these clusters that would not have

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
